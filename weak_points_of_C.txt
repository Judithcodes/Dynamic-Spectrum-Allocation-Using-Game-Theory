                                                  C Language

LOOPS :
1. “break” and “continue” can be used in “for”, “while” and “do-while” loop body. But only “break” can be used in “switch” body.

2. "switch" can compile without any any case at all,without breaks and default case but 2 cases cannot have the same value.

3. A switch expression can be int, char and enum. A float variable/expression cannot be used inside switch.

4. Output: 99 99 99 since i is declared again inside the loop its scope is limited within the loop.

      int main()
      {
          int i = 3;
          while(i--)
          {
              int i = 100;
              i--;
              printf("%d ",i);
          }
          return 0;
      }
      
5. int main()
   {
      unsigned int i = 65000;
      while (i++ != 0);
      printf("%d", i);
      return 0;
   }
   
   The result will be 1 but after a really long time because while loop will keep on going until i becomes 4294967295 (Assuming unsigned    int is stored using 4 bytes) and as i highest limit of unsigned int is 4294967295 in next ++ operation it will become zero and we'll    come out of loop and 1 will be printed.
   
6. "continue" skips over statements and goes for the loop directly.

7. Expression gets evaluated in cases. The control goes to the second case block after evaluating 1+2 = 3 and Quiz is printed.
      int main()
      {
          int i = 3;
          switch (i)
          {
              case 0+1: printf("Geeks");
                      break;
              case 1+2: printf("Quiz");
                      break;
              default: printf("GeeksQuiz");
          }
          return 0;
      }
      
8. If a variable is globally defined it gets initialized to zero by default.

1. The function fun() receives an array parameter arr[] and tries to find out number of elements in arr[] using sizeof operator.
   In C, array parameters are treated as pointers. So the expression sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]) becomes sizeof(int *)/sizeof(int) which      results in 1
