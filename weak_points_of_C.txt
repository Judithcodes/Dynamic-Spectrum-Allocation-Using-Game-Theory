LOOPS :
1. “break” and “continue” can be used in “for”, “while” and “do-while” loop body. But only “break” can be used in “switch” body.

2.

1. The function fun() receives an array parameter arr[] and tries to find out number of elements in arr[] using sizeof operator.
   In C, array parameters are treated as pointers. So the expression sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]) becomes sizeof(int *)/sizeof(int) which      results in 1
